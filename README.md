## Summary
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
  * 81.07% of all Rides were completed by Subscribers.
  * The bikeshare is located in a city, where people can easily use the service to both commute to work, as well as commute to social activities on the weekends.
  * If a rider is not a subscriber, there is a good chance that their gender is not known.
  * Largest Revenue Opportunity would be found amongst riders born in 1969. They make up 42.9% of all "Customer" Rides. 98% of these did not provide their Gender. 
  * I would suggest further investigating rides completed by those that are not subscribers, including the frequency of their rides and the locations of where they are riding to and from.
